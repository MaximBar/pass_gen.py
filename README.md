# pass_gen.py
# Password generator based on user's input 

# Made by Maxim Bardin with the generous help from his #python buddies at freenode.net
# Released under the GPLv3 License
# Made and tested with Python 3

# This script is meant for learning purposes, thus heavily commented.

# This program will generate a random password based on user's choices.

# Note that currently this script has a "bug", it won't repeat letters,numbers or symbols so:
# 1. all characters will be unique
# 2. the sum of the characters cannot be bigger than user's choice
# example, if user chooses 1 (lowercase abc), than the number of passwrd's characters
# cannot be greater than 26
# To correct this "bug" ,a different method is needed
